
Android JAVA SQLite and RSA encryption

Let's write an Android JAVA application that works with a SQLite database and uses strong RSA encryption of record fields.
Asymmetric RSA encryption is highly secure. Especially with keys of 2048 bits and more.
We will solve the technical problem of RSA encryption of large texts, indexing and data retrieval during encryption.
We will use database parameters that can be easily adapted to different types of business -
logistics, trade, manufacturing, warehouse, or even for the application of a financial notebook.
This Open Source project can be used as a template for a real Android JAVA application project.
