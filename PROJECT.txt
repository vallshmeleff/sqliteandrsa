
Android JAVA SQLite and RSA encryption

Let's write an Android JAVA application that works with a SQLite database and uses strong RSA encryption of record fields.
Asymmetric RSA encryption is highly secure. Especially with keys of 2048 bits and more.
We will solve the technical problem of RSA encryption of large texts, indexing and data retrieval during encryption.
We will use database parameters that can be easily adapted to different types of business -
logistics, trade, manufacturing, warehouse, or even for the application of a financial notebook.
This Open Source project can be used as a template for a real Android JAVA application project.
The application currently uses 5 fields in the database records. Planned to use 10 fields in SQLite database records.
This number of fields is sufficient for most applications on Android smartphones.
Now tested RSA encryption for the NOTES field for short records - up to 128 bytes. The next step in programming is
overcoming restrictions on the length of records.
RSA encryption requires a lot of CPU resources to process. This reduces the speed of working with the SQLite database.
However, RSA encryption provides the strongest data protection.
